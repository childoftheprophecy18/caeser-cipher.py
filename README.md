# Caesar Cipher Python Program

## Overview

This Python program implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. Users can specify the direction (encode or decode), input their message, and set the shift amount.

## Features

- **Encryption & Decryption:** The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages based on user input.
- **Shift Handling:** Handles shifts greater than the number of letters in the alphabet by using the modulus operator.
- **Non-Alphabetic Characters:** Maintains non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, spaces) unchanged during encryption/decryption.
- **Restart Option:** After each operation, the user can choose to restart the program for another encryption/decryption.
